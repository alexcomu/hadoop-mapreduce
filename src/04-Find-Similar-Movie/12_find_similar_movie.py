## Steps
# 1 - Find every pair of movies that were watched by tha same person
# 2 - Measure the similarity of their rating across all users who watched both
# 3 - Sort by movie, then by similarity strength

## MapReduce Problem

## Mapper: Extract User -> (Movie, Rating)
## Reducer: Groups all movie, rating pairs by user

## Mapper: Output all movies viewed by the same user (movie1, movie2) -> (rating1, rating2)
## Reducer: Compute rating-based similarity between each movie pair (movie1, movie2) -> (similarity, number of users who saw both)

## Mapper: Make movie name, similarity score the sorting key
## Reducer: Display the final sorted output

## -> Movie sorted by Name with a list of movie ordered by similaity
